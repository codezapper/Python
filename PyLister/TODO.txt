- Cleanup main.js
- Cleanup python code

- Fix playing when not submitted (e.g. when clicking with the mouse before pressing enter)
- Add list shuffling
- Add prefixes:
  - "shuffle:" adds shuffled results to the playlist
  - "repeat:" adds results and repeats them. This replaces the current list
  - "artist:", "album:", "title:" restrict search to related fields
- Add history of recently played songs
- Implement callback to play through shown items instead of having the path saved in the template
