This is a very simple text game to make practice with Python classes.

The basic idea of the game is to have a character (the "player") move from
battle to battle, with breaks in-between to visit a shop that allows to buy
a single random wearable item and some potions.
It is also possible for the player to trigger a "hard battle" by sacrificing
enough "illbane" to summon a stronger enemy.
The "player" can obtain "illbane" by eniemes that drop it when defeated, or
save money to buy it in the shop.
